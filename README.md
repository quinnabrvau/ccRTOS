# Priority Queue
This library implements a basic low overhead priority queue to be used in a C++ based RTOS.

## Goals
* self tested
* easily readable
* cross compilable - easy to run in both embedded systems and full computers
* efficient - will be small and runn quickly on embedded systems

## Test Goals
* stores multiple values
* new values are placed in priority order
* items are gotten from high priority to low priority
* highest priority is a low number (0 is max priority)
* supports different type inputs
